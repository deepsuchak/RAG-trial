How To Terraform Mars - WITH LASERS  \nMars is a disappointing hellhole lacking practically everything we need to stay alive.  \nIt looks like we'll only ever have small crews spend a miserable time hidden underground.  \nExcept we could terraform it into a green new world.  \nBut to solve the planet's problems, we first need to make it worse and turn it into oceans of lava with \ngigantic lasers.  \nThis isn't a far -fetched science fiction tale.  \nTerraforming Mars is possible on the kind of timescale our ancestors bu ilt great monuments in.  \nIf humanity solves some of its pressing problems and ventures into space to expand into the solar \nsystem, this may not be that far off.  \nOK, so how do we terraform Mars quickly?  \nWell, it's complicated.  \nMars is dry and has no soil to grow anything.  \nIts atmosphere is too thin to breathe or protect us from radiation, giving you a high risk of cancer.  \nSo to turn it into a new home for humanity, we have to give it a proper atmosphere, similar to Earth's.  \nIt should be made of 21% oxygen, 79 % nitrogen and a tiny bit of CO2 as an average temperature.  \nWe have to create oceans and rivers, and then the ground has to be weathered into fertile soil to host \nliving things.  \nThen we need to install a biosphere on the surface and prevent it all from bei ng undone by installing \nprotective measures that can stand the test of time.  \nIt is difficult, but a big laser makes it a lot easier.  \nSo we have to create a biosphere that can stand the test of time.  \nSome four billion years ago, Mars had a nice oxygen -rich atmosphere and was home to vast oceans and \nrivers.  \nIt held onto it for several hundred million years before it got blown away.  \nUltraviolet rays broke down the atmospheric gases and then the oceans until they were swept away by \nsolar wind.  \nToday, Mars is a dry, barren land.  \nLuckily, a sizable portion of the water is frozen in deep reservoirs and in the polar ice caps, enough to \ncreate a very shallow ocean.  \nAnd enormous amounts of oxygen are bound as minerals in the Martian rocks, like the oxygen in the \niron oxides that give the planet its rust red color, as well as carbon dioxide in carbonates.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2191, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n",

produce beams of 10 petawatts of power for a \ntrillionth of a second.  \nTo melt Mars, we need a laser twin.  \nThe easiest way is to use a solar -pumped laser that can be powered directly with sunlight.  \nAt its core are metal -infused glass rods that absorb energy and release it as a laser beam.  \nIf we build an array of mirrors in space about 11 times the size of the United States, we can focus \nenough sunligh t onto them to melt Mars.  \nLet's do it.  \nAs the lasers hit the surface, about 750 kilograms of oxygen and some carbon dioxide emerge from \nevery cubic meter of rock melted.  \nIf we are efficient, our lasers only need to melt through the top 8 meters of the surf ace to get enough \noxygen.  \nIt would look terrifying.  \nThe skies would be shrouded in storms,

would take about 50 years of continuous lasering to  create our oxygen atmosphere.  \nWe could use this opportunity to dig deeper in some places to create the basins for salty oceans or \nrivers and

flammable.  \nTo make it similar to Earth and a lot safer, we need to add a lot of nitrogen, which Mars is sadly lacking.  \nWe have to import it.  \nThe ideal source is Titan, a large moon of  Saturn, covered in a thick atmosphere that's almost entirely \nnitrogen.  \nWe just have to move 3,000 trillion tons from the outer solar system to Mars.  \nWhile that's not easy, it is doable.  \nTo process that much of Titan's atmosphere, we have to construct giant automated factories on its \nsurface powered by our lasers to suck in the atmosphere and compress it into a liquid.  \nThis gets pumped into bullet -shaped tanks, which are mass driver chutes all the way to the Red Planet, \nwhere they explode and mix with t he oxygen.  \nWe've already been able to send individual missions to Saturn in just a few years.  \nWith enough resources, it should be possible to complete the task within two generations.  \nOf course, it would be much more convenient to have nitrogen left over f rom

another ozone molecule.  \nBut the supernova radiation breaks up nitrogen molecules that gobble up the free oxygen, breaking the \ncycle, and depleting the ozone layer quickly.  \nWithout a radiation shield, e verybody living on the surface is exposed to very high levels of UV radiation \nfrom our sun.  \nCancer rates would skyrocket, and just going outside during the day could be life -threatening.  \nThe extra radiation would also kill a lot, if not most, of the plankt on in the oceans that live near the \nsurface and are the basis for the marine food chains, leading to a mass extinction.  \nWorse still, supernova radiation would ionize gas in the atmosphere, which means that it would punch \nthrough molecules and knock electro ns off nuclei, leaving them charged.  \nThese charged nuclei then act as seeds for water vapor to gather and form massive global clouds.  \nIn the worst case, they would reflect enough sunlight to trigger an ice age.  \nIn fact, it's thought that the ice age 2.5 mi llion years ago was caused by a supernova.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2605, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

kinds of black holes t hat we know for sure are out there.  \nStellar black holes.  \nTo make a black hole, we need to compress enough matter so that it collapses into itself.  \nAfter that, the more mass we throw at it, the larger it becomes.  \nIn today's universe, only the most violent cosmic events can create the necessary conditions,  \nsuch as the merger of neutron stars or when the core of a very massive star collapses in a supernova.  \nTo have a unit to work with here, we'll use the mass of our Sun, about 2 million trillion trillion kilo grams.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx":

they can quickly turn around the atmosphere of a planet because billions of years ago,  \nthey were probably responsible for turning the toxic atmosphere of our young Earth into an atmosp here \nwith enough oxygen for more complex animal life.  \nBut not only that, cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into nutrients that can \nbe used by living beings.  \nThis way, they will essentially fertilize our dead ocean water and pre pare it for more complex organisms.  \nOn land, our colonists need to grind down some of the former Venusian surface to make soil for \nnitrogen

watch, it wouldn't be \nenough to create a star.  \nInterestingly, adding lots of mass to a brown dwarf doesn't make it much bigger, just its insides denser.  \nThis increases the pressure in the core enough to make certain nuclear fusion reactions happen slowly \nand the object glow a little.  \nSo brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy gas giant that don't fit into any category very well.  \nBut we

are not very massive, they are small, not very hot and shine pretty  dimly.  \nThey are the only stars in the main sequence that don't grow once they die, but sort of fizzle out.  \nRed dwarfs are by far the most abundant type in the universe.  \nBecause they burn their fuel very slowly, it lasts them up to 10 trillion years, a thousand times the \ncurrent age of the universe.  \nFor example, one

Like rocket fuel, the photons released as solar radiation carry \nmomentum.  \nNot a lot, but a bit. For example, if an astronaut turned on a flashlight in space, it would push them \nbackwards very, very slowly.  \nA stellar engine will work a little better than a flashlight because the sun produces a lot of photons.  \nThe basic idea of the Shkadov thruster is to reflect up to half of the solar radiation to create thrust and  \nslowly push the sun where we want it to go.  \nIn order for the Shkadov thruster to work, it must be kept in the same place, not orbiting the sun.  \nAlthough the sun's gravity will try to pull it in, it would be supported by radiation pressure, which props \nthe mirror up.  \nThis means the mirror would have to be very light, made of micron -thin reflecting foil from materials like \naluminium alloys.  \nThe mirror's shape is important too. Enveloping the sun in a giant spherical shell wouldn't work because \nthat would ref ocus light back to the sun, heating it up and creating all sorts of unpleasant problems.  \nInstead, we use a parabola, which sends most of the photons around the sun and in the same direction, \nwhich maximises thrust.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2491, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc8f6b86-d952-40d5-8dc1-2252985ce6e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc8f6b86-d952-40d5-8dc1-2252985ce6e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29d6c0f9-0da5-47a3-818a-dff735ed25fd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "hash": "e40d4167e6f219e63b548a6fb85ff9d34d621399d086b637286d4481aa259f41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b9ed654-e546-47c8-a82f-d49a3968c3c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "hash": "33072a5bcec8f5e330e0957c870509fe9b101dca1ebbfae12555db7f580399ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0314830-becd-4a10-82cd-2f177d70df8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee6b95b0c5f572c16c0d76a18c0e16799ed684c08f13dad0c0f93b9fdf911504", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To prevent accidentally burning or freezi ng Earth with too much or too little sunlight, the only safe place \nto build a Shkadov thruster is over the sun's poles.  \nThis means we can only move the sun vertically in the plane of the solar system and one direction in the \nMilky Way, which limits our tra vel options a bit.  \nBut that is basically it.

payload?  \nA nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth is what you call infrastructure.  \nWhether it's roads for cars, ports for ships or rails for trains, we've made it easier to get to places.  \nWe can apply the same solution to space travel.  \nSpace infrastructure will make getting into orbit and out to the Moon, Mars and beyond easier and \ncheaper.  \nGreat, but what exactly is space infrastructure?  \nUnlike an Earth space elevator, which is currently science fiction, there is a simple yet promising \ntechnology that does not require new science,  \nmagic materials or huge investments and t hat has been tested successfully in orbit already.  \nA cable and a weight, known as a tether.  \nThe concept is so simple, it's surprising.  \nWhat if we put tethers, hundreds or thousands of kilometers long, into space and had spacecraft use \nthem as ladders to cl imb to higher altitudes and gain speed?  \nThis concept is known as the skyhook.  \nIt works even better if we make it spin.  \nA counterweight holds a long cable in place while it rotates around a circle.  \nA rotating tether slows down its tip relative to the ground  at the bottom and speeds it up at the top like \na catapult.  \nThis means that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost when released, more \nor less for free, equal to twice the tether's rotation velocity.  \nSpecialized fibers already exis t that can survive the extraordinary stresses a skyhook would be faced \nwith.  \nTo protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites, we can thread our tether into a web \nof redundant fibers.  \nSince our skyhook would pass over the same spot many ti mes a day, this would allow small reusable \nshuttles to catch up with it.  \nOf course, it's not that easy.  \nAt its lowest point, the tether's tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around 12,000 kilometers per \nhour.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2091,

we'll need specialized spacecraft that can get to the tether.  \nWhile this isn't exactly easy, it's still much cheaper than getting a big tin can filled with rocket fuel to go \n40,000 kilometers an hour.  \nCatching the tip will be a challenge too.  \nThere's only a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the sky moving at Mach 12.  \nTo make this easie r, the tip could

Maybe both.  \nWhat is a neutron star?  \nTo understand how extreme strange matter really is, we first need to get a few basics.  \nWhat is a neutron star and how does strange matter break the rules of the Universe?  \nTo get all of this into one video, we'll grossly oversimplify a few things,  \nbut we'll provide you with further reading if you want more details.  \nA neutron star is what remains after a very massive star explodes in a supernova.  \nWhen this happens, the star's core collapses under its own gravity  \nwith such a strong inwar d force that it squeezes nuclei and particles together violently.  \nElectrons are pushed into protons so they merge and turn into neutrons.  \nAll the nothing inside of atoms is suddenly completely filled with particles  \nthat really don't want to be close to eac h other but have no choice.  \nThey desperately push back against gravity, against the collapse.  \nIf gravity wins, they will become a black hole.  \nIf they win, they become a neutron star.  \nThis makes neutron stars like giant atomic nuclei the size of a city but holding the mass of our sun.  \nAnd here, things get weird.  \nThe environment in the core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of nuclear physics change.  \nAnd this could lead to a strange and extremely dangerous substance.  \nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1986, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2210cf85-a213-467c-8cf2-aa24cba84e54": {"__data__": {"id_": "2210cf85-a213-467c-8cf2-aa24cba84e54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5bc89dc-4529-4a5b-8189-804a9a844c91", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "hash": "7a9218a035bcc1e37da0d4732331355dd5cfb371842295083ed2869d7d15ec47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "221afbaa-6f05-4149-8ecd-706041d020a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "hash": "9aad9d4880d2f5ff83adbdab019fa46a52157dc2c0cf5dff52aa37777c2e78bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bef6ce13-d8f4-402f-a53b-d2c825de2ba1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a267fac81b8a9bc4db0456b384ecd5cf0581592684fc8a79d260a6ff880f0939", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We first need to know the rules before we learn how they can be broken.  \nProtons and neutrons, the particles making up the nuclei of atoms, are made up of smaller particles \ncalled quarks.  \nQuarks really don't want to be alone. They are what we cal l confined.  \nYou can try to separate them, but the harder you pull, the harder they try to pull themselves back \ntogether.  \nIf you use a lot of energy, they just use this energy to create new quarks.  \nQuarks only exist together as the building blocks of other particles and have never been observed by \nthemselves.  \nThey come in many types, but only two appear to make stable matter.  \nThe up and down quarks, found in protons and neutrons.  \nAll other quarks seem to decay away quickly.  \nBut this may be different inside n eutron stars.  \nThe forces operating in their cores are so extreme that they are actually similar to the universe shortly \nafter the Big Bang.  \nNeutron star cores are like fossils, which can let us peer back in time to the beginning of everything.  \nSo learning how quarks behave inside a neutron star is a way of understanding the very nature of the \nuniverse itself.  \nOne hypothesis is that inside a neutron star core, protons and neutrons deconfine.  \nAll the particles crammed shoulder to shoulder dissolve and melt in to a sort of bath of quarks.  \nUncountable numbers of particles become one giant thing made purely from quarks.  \nQuark matter.  \nA star made from this is called a quark star, though from the outside it may not look any different than a \nregular neutron star.  \nNow  we can finally talk about the most dangerous substance.  \nIf the pressure inside a quark star is great enough, it may get stranger.  \nLiterally.  \nIn the cores of neutron stars, some of the quarks may be converted into strange quarks.  \nStrange quarks have bizarr e nuclear properties, and they are heavier, and for the lack of a better word, \nstronger.  \nIf they turn up, they could create strange

Solar collectors, miners, refiners and launch \nequipment.  \nThe solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet.  \nTo start, maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them, either as mirrors or as \ntraditional solar panels.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2278, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac996045-859e-4ca2-98f8-259e3588fe74": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac996045-859e-4ca2-98f8-259e3588fe74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c502ffbe-00d1-4369-9879-6b783e2876ef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "hash": "0008c6450a6d90ff4d244761c6569414005743bc416d45083381d7caabfc562c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6e1fc3b-a8de-487b-b60f-a5d5d313a75e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "hash": "3d6deb4ab9c9b603a4f797b4d821041a2b1c4a06fe0553dae1ed946258151434", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "153989a7-10c8-4c6b-b6b3-3f8168658582", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5b86751bc6968f5c78836ef0d985143bdfaeb68bde08fd3bfc77e465bb3c9ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They'll provide the energy to run our miners, which strip -mine the surface of the planet, and our \nrefiners, which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our swarm satell ites.  \nTo get them into space, we need a creative and efficient solution.  \nRockets are too expensive and difficult to de -orbit and reuse.  \nInstead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun, a long electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at \nhigh speeds.  \nOur swarm satellites would be packed tight for launch, unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit.  \nFrom this point, we can take advantage of exponential growth, using the energy of the existing parts of \nthe swarm to build more infrastructure on Merc ury and launch new panels faster and faster.  \nEach panel provides the energy to build another.

payoff would be immeasurable.  \nThe moon is a sandbox to develop new technologies and  exploit unlimited resources.  \nIt would start a new space race and lay the foundation for us to spread out into

get governments interested in long -term investments in the future of humanity.  \nLet's imagine just doing it.  \nIf we start today, how would we build a moon base?  \nIn the first phase of the Age of Exploration of the  New World, for example,  \nEuropean monarchs funded expeditions to chart and discover and to stake their claims.  \nThey planted a flag and set up a camp, but they didn't stay.  \nIn the second phase, small missionaries set up a camp, but they didn't stay.  \nIn the third phase, small missionaries set up a camp, but they didn't stay.  \nIn the second phase, small missions set up outposts and settlements were founded,  \nwhich were still very dependent on their home countries for supplies.  \nSome failed, but others survived an d established a permanent presence.  \nOnly

It's very likely that this is a universal principle  \nfor civilizations, no matter where they're from.

It's very hard to make  \npredictions about how likely it is for life to emerge from dead things. There is  \nno consensus. Some scientists think it develops everywhere where the conditions  \nare right. Others think that Earth might be the only living place in the universe.  \nAnother candidate is the  step of complex animal cells.

The Paradox of an Infinite Universe  \nIs the universe infinite? Do es it have an edge? And if so, what would you see if you went there?  \nToday we know that the universe had a beginning 14 billion years ago and that it's been expanding ever \nsince.  \nBut something that's expanding should also have an edge, right? Well, it sort  of does.  \nInformation can't travel faster than light. That means that we can only see parts of the universe whose \nlight has had time to reach us in the last 14 billion years.  \nWhen we look outwards, what we see is a sphere centered on us, the observable uni verse.  \nBut it gets a tad more complicated. Because the universe has been expanding, we know that the most \nfar away things whose light we can see are actually 45 billion light years from us right now.  \nSo the observable universe is a sphere with a radius of 45 billion light years.  \nIt contains around 200 billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars.  \nSo for us, there is an edge. We're looking at the past until there is just no past left.  \nThis edge is really more like an edge in time and, in a sense , meaningless.  \nThe real universe is for sure bigger than what we can see. But how much?  \nThere are two options. Either the universe is really big but finite, or it's truly infinite.  \nA finite universe means that if you want to fill it with ice cream, you can  do it.  \nYou need a lot of ice cream, but it is a finite amount.  \nBut that leads to a weird problem. Such a universe should have an edge, a cosmic wall where space \nends.  \nAnd if there's an edge, there should be something outside that edge.  \nBut the universe, b y definition, is all there is. So how could there be stuff outside all there is?  \nDoes the idea of something outside of everything even make sense?  \nExcept, of course, there is a physics hack.  \nYou can have a universe that has no border, but that still could be filled with a finite amount of ice \ncream.  \nWhat if the universe is truly finite?  \nImagine an orange and a ready tiny ant.  \nThe ant can only see a small piece of the skin, just as you can only  see a small chunk of the universe.  \nBut if the ant starts walking, it will eventually walk around the whole orange and be back to its starting \npoint.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2261, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4430036-479f-4143-8e16-789bc064f02f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4430036-479f-4143-8e16-789bc064f02f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c40b2e52-0c00-468a-ad1f-889417b82709", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "hash": "6b36c680248eecbaa615baaf2a520f84c5e9c80ea8ce0ab4cdb24281505c736c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a30d354-61e4-461a-b7ea-d54c13f1cba3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "data\\data-space.pdf"}, "hash": "9389dde1ef562251516cae967d299f1c015dca78b9ee06334c9a3c9ca1ccd0ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80910788-046d-4158-a0d5-34cb7a376a74", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca533db8030ff9548392775b99c64d4c4d58efadfb8d3699e65121f5b404bb3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So the skin of an orange is not infinite, but it doesn't have a border.  \nThe universe is not like the skin of an orange, but it could be very similar.  \nInstead of a sphere, it could be a hypersphere, where 3D space is curled on itself.  \nWhich is impossible for your brain to visualize, unfortunately.  \nBut the point is, no borders, no outside of the hypersphere.  \nFrom our human ant perspective, our whole 3D space is like the peel of the orange.  \nIf you were aboard a spaceship flying in a straight line, you would eventually come back to Earth.  \nHow does any of this make sense?  \nThe actual physics is hard, so we have to si mplify and lie a bit here.  \nBut in a nutshell, it all boils down to gravity.  \nThe way it works is that mass creates gravity by bending spacetime.  \nThis bending is the strongest where the mass is, but sort of stretches on forever, like a very mild tension \nin the fabric of spacetime itself.  \nThis could bend the whole universe in a way where it bends back on itself, which then makes the \nhypersphere.  \nIf you find this confusing, we're with you.  \nIf the universe happens to be a hypersphere, how could we find out how b ig it is?  \nOn Earth, we can see things disappear below the horizon, and that helps us calculate how big the Earth \nis. \nScientists tried to find some sort of universe horizon that would reveal the scale of the cosmic sphere, \nbut didn't see anything.  \nWhich mea ns that if the universe is a hypersphere, it needs to be so big that from our perspective, it \nlooks like we're living on a flat surface.  \nFor this to make sense, a hyperspherical universe should be at least 1,000 times bigger than our \nobservable part.  \nIt co uld be a trillion times bigger for all we know, but not smaller than that.  \nSome scientists thought all of this is way too straightforward and came up with a wilder option.  \nThe universe could be like the frosting of a donut.
